# Deep Learning

Here I explore to Deep Learning algorithms Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. Both algorithms are used to explore different problems. 

Here I use an ANN to discover the reason behind why certain customer are leaving a bank so that the bank can address that particular problem.

On the other hand, I used a CNN to build software that'll be able to distinguish and accurately predict whether a picture is either a dog or a cat. This requires being fed hundreds of different images. CNN is generally what is used for writing Computer Vision software.

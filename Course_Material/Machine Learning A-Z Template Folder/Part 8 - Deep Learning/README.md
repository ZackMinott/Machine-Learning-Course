# Deep Learning

Here I explore to Deep Learning algorithms Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. Both algorithms are used to explore different problems. 

Here I use an ANN to discover the reason behind why certain customer are leaving a bank so that the bank can address that particular problem.

On the other hand, I used a CNN to build software that'll be able to distinguish and accurately predict whether a picture is either a dog or a cat. This requires being fed hundreds of different images. CNN is generally what is used for writing Computer Vision software. 

## NOTE

- These algorithms are generally very slow to run because of the immense amount of data it requires to process, that is why it is highly necessary to rather use XGBoost in order to drastically reduce the time it takes for a Neural Network to process data.

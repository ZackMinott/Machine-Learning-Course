# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms 

Here I demonstrate competency in two separate reinforcement learning algorithms: Upper-Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling. Reinforcement Learning is used to allow software to make decisions based off a reward-based system. 

Here I use these algorithms to allow software to deduce which is the most desirable ad based on a dataset of user votes.
